Most modern attacks are considered blended attacks and these attacks are called blended because the attackers use multiple techniques to infiltrate and attack a system, when an attack cannot be prevented, it is the job of the cybersecurity professional to reduce the impact.
Security vulnerability is any kind of software or hardware defect.
An exploit is a program written to take advantage of a vulnerability.
An attack is the act of using an exploit against a vulnerability. And the goal of an attack is to have access to the system, the data it hosts or to a specific source.
Software vulnerability are usually introduced by errors in the operating system or application code. To avoid this, always verify the integrity of the downloaded operating system and limit the physical access of equipment to authorized personnel.
The goal of software updates is to stay current and avoid exploitation of vulnerabilities
Hardware vulnerability are often introduced by hardware design flaws. This vulnerability are specific to device models and are not generally exploit through random compromising attempts. An example of a design flaw exploit is Rowhammer, it was created as a result pf rewriting memory in the same address and its exploit allows data to be retrieved from nearby address memory cells, even if the cells are protected. Hardware exploit are more common in highly targeted attacks. Traditional malware protection and a physical security are sufficient protection for the users. 
Categories of Software vulnerability;
Buffer overflow: Buffers are memory areas allocate to an application. This vulnerability occurs when data is written beyond the limits of a buffer. By changing data beyond the boundaries of a buffer, the application accesses memory allocated to other processes thereby leading to system crash, data compromise, or provide escalation of privileges.
Non-Validated input: Programs works with data input. When data coming into a program has malicious content, it forces the program to work in an unintended way.
Race Conditions: A race condition becomes a source of vulnerability when the required ordered or timed events do not occur in the correct order or proper timing.
Weakness in security Practices: Systems and sensitive data can be protected through techniques such as authentication,authorization, and encryption. Developers should not r=try to create their own security algorithm because it will likely introduce vulnerability. It is advised they use security libraries that have already created, tested and verified.
Access Control problems:  Access control is the process of controlling who does what and ranges from managing physical access to equipment to dictating who has access to a resource, such as a file, and what they can do with it, such as read or change the file. Many security vulnerabilities are created by the improper use of access controls. Access controls can be overcome once the attacker has physical access to the target equipment. To protect machines, physical access must be restricted and encryption techniques must be used to protect data from being stolen or corrupted.
Malware is any code that can be used to steal data, bypass access controls, or cause harm to, or compromise a system.
Types of Malware:
Spyware: This a malware designed to spy on the user. They include; activity trackers, keystroke collection, and data capture. They attack by modifying security settings. They operate by bundling itself with legitimate software or with trojan horses.
Adware: They are advertisement supported software designed to automatically deliver advertisement. It is often installed with some versions of software and it is common for it to come with spyware.
Bot: It is a malware designed to automatically perform action usually online, most of them are harmless but one malicious one is the botnets. When computers are infected with bots, they quietly wait for commands provided by the attacker.
Ransomware: This malware is designed to hold a computer system or the data it contains captive until a payment is made. Some other versions of ransomware is to take advantage of system vulnerability to lock down the system. It is usually done by encrypting data in the computer with a key unknown to the user and it is spread by a downloaded file or software vulnerability.
Scareware: This is a malware designed to persuade a user to take specific action out of fear. Scareware forges pop-up windows that resemble operating system dialogue windows. These windows convey forged messages stating the system is at risk or needs the execution of a specific program to return to normal operation. In reality, no problems were assessed or detected and if the user agrees and clears the mentioned program to execute, his or her system will be infected with malware.
Rootkit: This malware is designed to modify the operating system to create a backdoor. Attackers use the backdoor to access the system remotely. Most rootkits take advantage of software vulnerabilities to perform privilege escalation and modify system files. It is also common for rootkits to modify system forensics and monitoring tools, making them very hard to detect. Often, a computer infected by a rootkit must be wiped and reinstalled.
Virus: A virus is a malicious executable code attached to other executable files. Most virus require end user activation and can activate at a specific time or date. They can mutate to avoid detection and most of them are spread by USB drives, optical disks, network shares or email.
Trojan horse: A trojan horse is a malware that carries out a malicious operation under the guise of a desired operation. They are found in image files, audio files or games. It binds itself to non-executable files.
Worms: They are malicious codes that replicate themselves by independently exploiting vulnerabilities in networks. Unlike virus, worm can run by themselves, they no longer require user participation. They share similar pattern and have an enabling vulnerability and they al contain a payload.
Man in the Middle (MITM): This allows attackers to take control over a device without the users knowledge, it intercepts and capture user information before relaying it to its intended destination. They are mostly used to steal financial information and many malware and technique exist to provide attackers with MITM capabilities.
Man in the mobile (MITMO): A variation of man in the middle, its an attack used to take control over a mobile device, when infected, the mobile device is instructed to exfiltrate user-sensitive information and send it to the attackers. An example of exploit is Zeus, it allows attackers to capture the two step verification SMS messages sent to user.
Symptoms of Malware:
Increase in CPU usage
Decrease in computer speed
Computer freezes or crashes often
There is decrease in we browsing speed
Unexplainable problems with network connection
Files are modified
Files are deleted
There is a presence of unknown files, programs or desktop icons.
There are unknown processes running
Programs are turning off or reconfiguring themselves
Emails is being sent without the users knowledge or consent.
