A threat is a possibility, that a harmful event such as an attack will occur.
Vulnerability is a weakness that makes a target susceptible to an attack.
An attack is a deliberate exploitation of a discoverd weakness in computer information systems, either as a specific targets or targets of opportunity.
Malicious software, or malware, is a term used to describe software designed to disrupt computer operations, or gain access to computer systems, without the user's knowledge or permission. They include; computer viruses, worms, trojan horse, spyware, adware, ransomware, scareware and other malicious programs. They can be simple to identify and they can be almost impossible to detect.
A virus is malicious executable code attached to another executable file, such as a legitimate program. Computer viruses usually spread in one of three ways: from removable media; from downloads off the Internet; and from email attachments. They can be harmless by simply displaying a picture or destructive by modifying or deleting data. They mutate to avoid detection. The simple act of opening a file can trigger a virus. A boot sector, or file system virus, infects USB flash drives and can spread to the system’s hard disk. Executing a specific program can activate a program virus. Once the program virus is active, it will usually infect other programs on the computer or other computers on the network.
Worms are malicious code that replicates by independently exploiting vulnerabilities in networks. Worms usually slow down networks. Whereas a virus requires a host program to run, worms can run by themselves. Other than the initial infection, worms no longer require user participation. After a worm affects a host, it is able to spread very quickly over the network. Worms share similar patterns. They all have an enabling vulnerability, a way to propagate themselves, and they all contain a payload.
A Trojan horse is malware that carries out malicious operations under the guise of a desired operation such as playing an online game. This malicious code exploits the privileges of the user that runs it. A Trojan horse differs from a virus because the Trojan binds itself to non-executable files, such as image files, audio files, or games.
A logic bomb is a malicious program that uses a trigger to awaken the malicious code. For example, triggers can be dates, times, other programs running, or the deletion of a user account. The logic bomb remains inactive until that trigger event happens. Once activated, a logic bomb implements a malicious code that causes harm to a computer. It can sabotage database records, erase files, and attack operating systems or applications.
Ransomware holds a computer system, or the data it contains, captive until the target makes a payment. Ransomware usually works by encrypting data in the computer with a key unknown to the user. The user must pay a ransom to the criminals to remove the restriction. They can also take advantage of specific system vulnerability to lock down the system, they work as a trojan horse and it comes as a result of a downloaded file or some software weakness. Once the victim pays through an untraceable payment system the criminal supplies a program that decrypts the files or sends an unlock code.
A backdoor refers to the program or code introduced by a criminal who has compromised a system. The backdoor bypasses the normal authentication used to access a system. A few common backdoor programs are Netbus and Back Orifice, which both allow remote access to unauthorized system users. The purpose of the backdoor is to grant the cyber criminals future access to the system even if the organization fixes the original vulnerability used to attack the system. These backdoors are installed by authorized users when they unknowingly install a trojan horse program on their machine.
A rootkit modifies the operating system to create a backdoor. Attackers then use the backdoor to access the computer remotely. Most rootkits take advantage of software vulnerabilities to perform privilege escalation and modify system files.
Privilege escalation takes advantage of programming errors or design flaws to grant the criminal elevated access to network resources and data. It is also common for rootkits to modify system forensics and monitoring tools, making them very hard to detect. Often, a user must wipe and reinstall the operating system of a computer infected by a rootkit.
Defending against Malware: Steps taken to defend against all forms of Malware are;
Antivirus Program - The majority of antivirus suites catch most widespread forms of malware. However, cyber criminals develop and deploy new threats on a daily basis. Therefore, the key to an effective antivirus solution is to keep the signatures updated. A signature is like a fingerprint. It identifies the characteristics of a piece of malicious code.
Up-to-Date Software - Many forms of malware achieve their objectives through exploitation of vulnerabilities in software, both in the operating system and applications. Therefore, there is need to keep system and application software updated to vane off all vulnerabilities.
Spam are unsolicited email. They can send harmful links, malware, or deceptive content with the aim of obtaining sensitive information such as a social security number or bank account information. Most spam comes from multiple computers on networks infected by a virus or worm. These compromised computers send out as much bulk email as possible.
Indicators of spam includes;
An email has no subject line
An email is requesting an update to an account
The email text has misspelled words or strange punctuation.
Links within the email are long and/or cryptic.
An email looks like correspondence from a legitimate business.
The email requests that the user open an attachment.
Spyware is software that enables a criminal to obtain information about a user’s computer activities. They include activity trackers, keystroke collection, and data capture. They often modify security setting in an attempt to overcome security measures and they often bundle themselves with legitimate software or trojan horse. 
Adware typically displays annoying pop-ups to generate revenue for its authors. The malware may analyze user interests by tracking the websites visited. It can then send pop-up advertising pertinent to those sites. Some versions of software automatically install Adware. Some adware only delivers advertisements, but it is also common for adware to come with spyware.
Scareware persuades the user to take a specific action based on fear. Scareware forges pop-up windows that resemble operating system dialogue windows. These windows convey forged messages stating that the system is at risk or needs the execution of a specific program to return to normal operation. In reality, no problems exist, and if the user agrees and allows the mentioned program to execute, malware infects his or her system.
Phishing occurs when a malicious party sends a fraudulent email disguised as being from a legitimate, trusted source. The message intent is to trick the recipient into installing malware on his or her device or into sharing personal or financial information. An example of phishing is an email forged to look like it came from a retail store asking the user to click a link to claim a prize. The link may go to a fake site asking for personal information, or it may install a virus.
Spear phishing is a highly targeted phishing attack. While phishing and spear phishing both use emails to reach the victims, spear phishing sends customized emails to a specific person. The criminal researches the target’s interests before sending the email.  For example, a criminal learns that the target is interested in cars and has been looking to buy a specific model of car. The criminal joins the same car discussion forum where the target is a member, forges a car sale offering, and sends an email to the target. The email contains a link for pictures of the car. When the target clicks on the link, he or she unknowingly installs malware on the computer.
Vishing is phishing using voice communication technology. Criminals can spoof calls from legitimate sources using voice over IP (VoIP) technology. Victims may also receive a recorded message that appears legitimate. Criminals want to obtain credit card numbers or other information to steal the victim’s identity. Vishing takes advantage of the fact that people trust the telephone network.
Smishing (Short Message Service phishing) is phishing using text messaging on mobile phones. Criminals impersonate a legitimate source in an attempt to gain the trust of the victim. For example, a smishing attack might send the victim a website link. When the victim visits the website, malware is installed on the mobile phone.
Pharming is the impersonation of a legitimate website in an effort to deceive users into entering their credentials. Pharming misdirects users to a fake website that appears to be official. Victims then enter their personal information thinking that they connected to a legitimate site.
Whaling is a phishing attack that targets high profile targets within an organization such as senior executives. Additional targets include politicians or celebrities.
Browser Plugins and Browser Poisoning:
Plugins display the content developed using the appropriate software. A cyber criminal can hack a browser plugins.
SEO Poisoning: Search Engine Optimization(SEO) is a set of techniques used to improve a website's ranking by a search engine. While many legitimate companies specialize in optimizing websites to better position them, SEO poisoning uses SEO to make a malicious website appear higher in search results.The most common goal of SEO poisoning is to increase traffic to malicious sites that may host malware or perform social engineering. To force a malicious site to rank higher in search results, attackers take advantage of popular search terms.
Browser Hijacker: A browser hijacker is malware that alters a computer's browser settings to redirect the user to websites paid for by the cyber criminals' customers. Browser hijackers usually install without the user's permission and are usually part of a drive-by download. A drive-by download is a program that automatically downloads to the computer when a user visits a web site or views an HTML email message. Always read user agreements carefully when downloading programs to avoid this type of malware.
Defending Against Email and Browser Attacks: Methods for dealing with spam include filtering email, educating the user about being cautious towards unknown email(s), and using host/server filters. Many antivirus and email software programs automatically performs email filtering. Organizations must also make employees aware of the dangers of opening email attachments that may contain a virus or a worm. Do not assume that email attachments are safe, even when they come from a trusted contact. A virus may be trying to spread by using the sender’s computer. Always scan email attachments before opening them. The Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) is an industry association focused on eliminating the identity theft and fraud that result from phishing and email spoofing.
Social Engineering: Social engineering is an attack that attempts to manipulate individuals into performing actions or divulging confidential information. It is a non-technical means for a criminal to gather information on a target.
Social Engineer rely on several tactics and these tactics includes;
Authority – people are more likely to comply when instructed by “an authority”. E.g. An executive opens an infected PDF that looks like an official subpoena.
Intimidation – criminals bully a victim into taking action. E.g; When a secretary is been asked to give out some information thinking is an order from her boss.
Consensus/Social Proof – people will take action if they think that other people like it too. E.g; Criminals creating website with fake testimonials that is promoting a product indicating that is safe.
Scarcity – people will take action when they think there is a limited quantity. E.g; Criminals offer a limited opportunity that will not last hoping to spur the victim into taking action quickly.
Urgency – people will take action when they think there is a limited time. E.g; Criminals establishing a deadline for taking action based on a certain price.
Familiarity/Liking – Criminals build a rapport with the victim to establish a relationship thereby making them do things for them because of likeness.
Trust – Criminals build a trusting relationship with a victim which may require more time to establish.
Social Engineering in Reverse:Reverse social engineering (RSE) has three steps: sabotage, advertising, and assisting. In the first step, a social engineer finds a way to sabotage a network. This can be as complex as launching a network attack against a target website ,to as simple as sending an email from a spoofed email address telling users that they are infected with a virus. No matter what technique is employed, the social engineer has either sabotaged the network or given the impression that the network is sabotaged. Next, the social engineer advertises his or her services as a security consultant. This can be done through many means including sending mailers, dropping business cards, or sending emails that advertise his or her services. At this point, the social engineer has created a problem in the network (sabotage) and is placing himself/herself in a position to help (advertising). The corporation sees the advertisement, contacts the engineer under the false pretense that the social engineer is a legitimate consultant, and allows the social engineer to work on the network. Once in, the social engineer gives the impression of fixing the problem (assisting) but will really do something malicious, such as planting keyloggers or stealing confidential data.
Shoulder Surfing is a situation where an attacker can be in close proximity to his victim or a situation where the attacker uses binoculars or closed circuit camera to shoulder surf.
Dumpster Diving is the process of going through a target's trash to see what information an organization throws out. Any sensitive information should be properly disposed through the use of burn bags, shredding or by fire.
Impersonation is the action of pretending to be someone else. Criminals also use impersonation to attack others. They can undermine the credibility of individuals by using website or social media postings.
A hoax is an act intended to deceive or trick. A cyber hoax can cause just as much disruption as an actual breach would cause. A hoax elicits a user reaction. The reaction can create unnecessary fear and irrational behavior. Users pass hoaxes through email and social media.
Piggybacking occurs when a criminal tags along with an authorized person to gain entry into a secure location or a restricted area. Criminals use several methods to piggyback and they include;
They give the appearance of being escorted by the authorized individual.
They join a large crowd pretending to be a member.
They target a victim who is careless about the rules of the facility
A mantrap prevents piggybacking by using two sets of doors. After individuals enter an outer door, that door must close before entering the inner door.
Defending Against Deception: In protecting organization, employees needs to be properly educated on social engineering tactics and prevention measures such as;
Never provide confidential information or credentials via email, chat sessions, in-person, or on the phone to unknown parties.
Resist the urge to click on enticing emails and website links.
Keep an eye out for uninitiated or automatic downloads.
Establish policies and educate employees about those policies.
When it comes to security, give employees a sense of ownership.
Do not fall to pressure from unknown individuals.
Denial of Service(DoS): A DoS attack results in some sort of interruption of network services to users, devices, or applications. They are two major types of DoS attack and they are;
Overwhelming Quantity of Traffic – The attacker sends an enormous quantity of data at a rate that the network, host, or application cannot handle. This causes a slowdown in transmission or response, or a crash of a device or service.
Maliciously Formatted Packets – The attacker sends a maliciously formatted packet to a host or application and the receiver is unable to handle it.
A Distributed DoS Attack (DDoS) is similar to a DoS attack, but it originates from multiple, coordinated sources. As an example, a DDoS attack could proceed as follows:
An attacker builds a network of infected hosts, called a botnet, comprised of zombies. Zombies are the infected hosts. The attacker uses handler systems to control the zombies. The zombie computers constantly scan and infect more hosts, creating more zombies. When ready, the hacker instructs the handler systems to make the botnet of zombies carry out a DDoS attack.
Sniffing: Sniffing is similar to eavesdropping on someone. It occurs when attackers examine all network traffic as it passes through their NIC, independent of whether or not the traffic is addressed to them or not. Criminals accomplish network sniffing with a software application, hardware device, or a combination of the two.Sniffing views all network traffic or it can target a specific protocol, service, or even string of characters such as a login or password.
Sniffing also has its benefits. Network administrators may also use sniffers to analyze network traffic, identify bandwidth issues, and troubleshoot other network issues. Physical security is important in preventing the introduction of sniffers on the internal network.
Spoofing: Spoofing is an impersonation attack, and it takes advantage of a trusted relationship between two systems. If two systems accept the authentication accomplished by each other, an individual logged onto one system might not go through an authentication process again to access the other system. An attacker can take advantage of this arrangement by sending a packet to one system that appears to have come from a trusted system. Since the trusted relationship is in place, the targeted system may perform the requested task without authentication.
There are multiply types of spoofing attack which are;
MAC address spoofing occurs when one computer accepts data packets based on the MAC address of another computer.
IP spoofing sends IP packets from a spoofed source address to disguise itself.
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a protocol that resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses for transmitting data. ARP spoofing sends spoofed ARP messages across a LAN to link the criminal’s MAC address with the IP address of an authorized member of the network.
The Domain Name System (DNS) associates domain names with IP addresses. DNS server spoofing modifies the DNS server to reroute a specific domain name to a different IP address controlled by the criminal.
Main-in-the-Middle(MitM): This attack is done by intercepting communications between computers to steal information crossing the network. MitM allows the criminal to take control over a device without the user’s knowledge.
Man-In-The-Mobile (MitMo) is a variation of man-in-middle. MitMo takes control over a mobile device.
A replay attack occurs when an attacker captures a portion of a communication between two hosts and then retransmits the captured message later. Replay attacks circumvent authentication mechanisms.
Zero-Day Attacks: A zero-day attack, sometimes referred to as a zero-day threat, is a computer attack that tries to exploit software vulnerabilities that are unknown or undisclosed by the software vendor. The term zero hour describes the moment when someone discovers the exploit. Defending against these fast-moving attacks requires network security professionals to adopt a more sophisticated view of the network architecture.  It is no longer possible to contain intrusions at a few points in the network.
Keyboard Logging: Keyboard logging is a software program that records or logs the keystrokes of the user of the system. Criminals can implement keystroke loggers through software installed on a computer system or through hardware physically attached to a computer. The criminal configures the key logger software to email the log file. The keystrokes captured in the log file can reveal usernames, passwords, websites visited, and other sensitive information. Keyboard loggers can be legitimate, commercial software.
Defending Against Attacks: Configure firewalls to discard any packets from outside of the network that have addresses indicating that they originated from inside the network. This situation does not normally occur, and it indicates that a cyber criminal attempted a spoofing attack.
To prevent DoS and DDoS attacks, ensure patches and upgrades are current, distribute the workload across server systems, and block external Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets at the border. Network devices use ICMP packets to send error messages. For example, the ping command uses ICMP packets to verify that a device can communicate with another on the network.
Systems can prevent falling victim to a replay attack by encrypting traffic, providing cryptographic authentication, and including a time stamp with each portion of the message.
Grayware and SMishing: Grayware includes applications that behave in an annoying or undesirable manner. It may not have recognizable malware concealed within, but it still may pose a risk to the user, it is usually found between smartphones. SMiShing is short for SMS phishing. It uses Short Message Service (SMS) to send fake text messages. The criminals trick the user into visiting a website or calling a phone number. Unsuspecting victims may then provide sensitive information such as credit card information. Visiting a website might result in the user unknowingly downloading malware that infects the device.
Rogue Access Point: A rogue access point is a wireless access point installed on a secure network without explicit authorization. It can be set up in two ways; The first is when a well-intentioned employee is trying to be helpful by making it easier to connect mobile devices. The second way is when a criminal gains physical access to an organization by sneaking in and installs the rogue access point. The Rogue access point can also be referred to as criminal's access point where he criminal sets up the access point as a MitM device to capture login information from users.
An Evil Twin attack uses the criminal’s access point improved with higher power and higher gain antennas to look like a better connection option for users. After users connect to the evil access point, the criminals can analyze traffic and execute MitM attacks.
Radio Frequency(RF) Jamming:Radio frequency (RF) jamming disrupts the transmission of a radio or satellite station so that the signal does not reach the receiving station. The frequency, modulation, and power of the RF jammer needs to be equal to that of the device that the criminal wants to disrupt in order to successfully jam the wireless signal.
Bluejacking and Bluesnarfing: Bluetooth is a short-range, low-power protocol. Bluetooth transmits data in a personal area network, or PAN, and can include devices such as mobile phones, laptops, and printers. Easy configuration is a characteristic of Bluetooth, so there is no need for network addresses. Bluetooth uses pairing to establish the relationship between devices. When establishing the pairing, both devices use the same passkey. Bluetooth vulnerabilities have surfaced, but due to the limited range of Bluetooth, the victim and the attacker need to be within range of each other.
Bluejacking is the term used for sending unauthorized messages to another Bluetooth device. A variation of this is to send a shocking image to the other device.
Bluesnarfing occurs when the attacker copies the victim's information from his device. This information can include emails and contact lists.
Wired Equivalent Privacy(WEP) and Wi-Fi Protected Access(WPA) Attacks:Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is a security protocol that attempted to provide a wireless local area network (WLAN) with the same level of security as a wired LAN. WEP seeks protection over WLAN with encryption key but there is no provision for key management because the number of people using the key will continuously grow. WEP also has several problems with its initialization vector (IV) which is one of the components of the cryptographic system. It is a 24-bit field, which is too small. It is clear text, which means it is readable. It is static so identical key streams will repeat on a busy network.
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and then WPA2 came out as improved protocols to replace WEP. WPA2 does not have the same encryption problems because an attacker cannot recover the key by observing traffic. WPA2 is susceptible to attack because cyber criminals can analyze the packets going between the access point and a legitimate user. Cyber criminals use a packet sniffer and then run attacks offline on the passphrase.
Defending Against Wireless and Mobile Device Attacks: There are several steps to take to defend against wireless and mobile device attacks. Most WLAN products use default settings. Take advantage of the basic wireless security features such as authentication and encryption by changing the default configuration settings.
Restrict access point placement with the network by placing these devices outside the firewall or within a demilitarized zone (DMZ) which contains other untrusted devices such as email and web servers.
WLAN tools such as NetStumbler may discover rogue access points or unauthorized workstations. Develop a guest policy to address the need when legitimate guests need to connect to the Internet while visiting. For authorized employees, utilize a remote access virtual private network (VPN) for WLAN access.
Cross-Site Scripting(XSS): Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability found in web applications. XSS allows criminals to inject scripts into the web pages viewed by users. This script can contain malicious code. 
Cross-site scripting has three participants: the criminal, the victim, and the website. The cyber-criminal does not target a victim directly. The criminal exploits vulnerability within a website or web application. Criminals inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by users, the victims. The malicious script unknowingly passes to the user's browser. A malicious script of this type can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information. If criminals obtain the victim’s session cookie, they can impersonate that user.
Code Injection: One way to store data at a website is to use a database. There are several different types of databases such as a Structured Query Language (SQL) database or an Extensible Markup Language (XML) database. Both XML and SQL injection attacks exploit weaknesses in the program such as not validating database queries properly.
XML Injection: When using an XML database, an XML injection is an attack that can corrupt the data. After the user provides input, the system accesses the required data via a query. The problem occurs when the system does not properly scrutinize the input request provided by the user. Criminals can manipulate the query by programming it to suit their needs and can access the information on the database. They can make any number of changes to the website and this attacks threaten the security of the website.
SQL Injection:The cyber criminal exploits a vulnerability by inserting a malicious SQL statement in an entry field. Again, the system does not filter the user input correctly for characters in an SQL statement. Criminals use SQL injection on websites or any SQL database. Criminals can spoof an identity, modify existing data, destroy data, or become administrators of the database server. 
Buffer Overflow: A buffer overflow occurs when data goes beyond the limits of a buffer. Buffers are memory areas allocated to an application. By changing data beyond the boundaries of a buffer, the application accesses memory allocated to other processes. This can lead to a system crash, data compromise, or provide escalation of privileges. The generic classification of buffer overflows includes many variants, such as static buffer overruns, indexing errors, format string bugs, Unicode and ANSI buffer size mismatches, and heap overruns.
Remote Code Executions: Remote code execution allows a criminal to execute any command on a target machine. An example is a Metasploit, A Metasploit is a tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target. Meterpreter is an exploit module within Metasploit that provides advanced features. Meterpreter allows criminals to write their own extensions as a shared object. Criminals upload and inject these files into a running process on the target. Meterpreter loads and executes all of the extensions from memory, so they never involve the hard drive. This also means that these files fly under the radar of antivirus detection. Meterpreter has a module for controlling a remote system’s webcam. Once a criminal installs Meterpreter on the victim’s system, he or she can view and capture images from the victim’s webcam.
ActiveX Controls and Java: ActiveX controls are pieces of software installed by users to provide extended capabilities. They provide the capability of a plugin to internet explorer.  Third parties write some ActiveX controls and they may be malicious. They can monitor browsing habits, install malware, or log keystrokes. ActiveX controls also work in other Microsoft applications.
Java operates through an interpreter called the Java Virtual Machine(JVM); it enables the Java program's functionality. The JVM sandboxes or isolates untrusted code from the rest of the operating system. There are vulnerabilities, which allow untrusted code to go around the restrictions imposed by the sandbox. There are also vulnerabilities in the Java class library, which an application uses for its security. Java is the second biggest security vulnerability next to Adobe’s Flash plugin.
Defending Against Application Attacks: The first line of defense against an application attack is to write solid code. Regardless of the language used, or the source of outside input, prudent programming practice is to treat all input from outside a function as hostile. Validate all inputs as if they were hostile.
Keep all software including operating systems and applications up to date, and do not ignore update prompts. Not all programs update automatically. At the very least, select the manual update option. Manual updates allow users to see exactly what updates take place.
