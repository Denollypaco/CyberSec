Cybersecurity professionals are best described as experts charged  with the protection of cyberspace. John McCumber is one of the early cybersecurity experts that developed a framework called the McCumber Cube or the Cybersecurity Cube. This cube looks like a Rubik's cube and is a tool used  when managing the protection of networks, domains and the internet. This cube consist of three dimensions which are;
The first dimension is known as the CIA Triad also referred to as the three principles of information security.
The second dimension of the cube consist of the Three states of information or data.
The third dimension of the cube identifies the expertise required to provide protection. These dimensions are often called the categories of cybersecurity safeguards.
The First Dimension are the foundational principles that identifies goals to protect cyberspace. These three principles are Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability(CIA). They provide focus and enable the cybersecurity expert to prioritize actions when protecting any networked system. They are referred to as the Security Principles and thus can be explained further as;
Confidentiality(Privacy) prevents the disclosure of information to unauthorized people, resources, or processes. Method to ensure this include; data encryption, authentication, and access control.
Integrity(Quality) refers to the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of data. Methods used to ensure data integrity include; Hashing, data validation checks, data consistency checks, and access controls.
Availability ensures that information is accessible by authorized users when needed. method to ensure availability includes; system redundancy, system backups, increased system resiliency, equipment maintenance, up-to-date operating systems and software, and plans in place to recover quickly from unforeseen disasters. 
The second dimension is referred to as the Information States, this dimension focuses on the problems of protecting all of the states of data in the cyberspace. These states includes;
Transmission: Data in transit.
Storage: Data at rest or in storage
Processing: Data in process. Cybersecurity professionals are responsible for the safeguarding of data in all three states.
The third dimension defines the skill and discipline a cybersecurity professional can call upon to protect the cyberspace and they must do this while maintaining the right side of the law. These skills can be called Countermeasures and they are of three types which are;
Technology: These includes technologies, devices, and products available to protect information systems and fend off cyber criminals.
Policies and Practice: Cybersecurity professionals must build strong defense by establishing policies, procedures, and guidelines that enable the users of cyberspace to stay safe and follow good practices.
People: Users of cyberspace must also be knowledgeable about the threats of the cyberspace and establish a culture of learning and awareness.
Principles of Confidentiality:
Sensitive information is data protected from unauthorized access to safeguard an individual or an organization. There are three types of sensitive information and they are;
Personal Information which entails an individual's Personally Identifiable Information(PII) and it includes; Social Security Number, Medical Records, Credit Card Numbers, and  Financial Records.
Business Information entails anything that poses a risk to the organization if discovered by the public or a competitor. These information can be; Trade secrets, Acquisition Plans, Financial Data and Customer Information.
Classified information are information belonging to a government body classified by its level of sensitivity. These sensitivity can be classified into four which are; Top Secret, Secret, Confidential, Restricted.
Access control defines a number of protection schemes that prevent unauthorized access to a computer, network, database, or other data resources.
The primary framework to Access control consist of three security services which are; Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting(AAA).
Authentication verifies the identity of a user to prevent unauthorized access. In this concept, the user is expected to provide any of the below; Something they know(such as a password), Something you have(such as token or card), Something they are(such as fingerprint). The most popular form of authentication is the use of password.
Authorization services determine which resources users can access, along with the operations that users can perform. This processes can be accomplished using the Access Control List(ACL), This list determines whether a user has certain access privileges once the user authenticates.
Accounting keeps track of what users do, including what they access, the amount of time they access resources, and any changes made. An example of a cybersecurity accounting is the website Norse; it shows attacks in real-time based on data collected as part of an accounting or tracking system.
Principles of Data Integrity:
Need For Data Integrity: The need for data integrity varies based on how an organization uses data. A financial institution assigns a higher importance to data integrity than a social media site, so is it with a health care organization.
Data integrity is of different levels and they are;
Critical Level comprises of Healthcare and Emergency services, in this case, All data is validated and tested, Data is verified to provide trustworthiness. Example include healthcare and financial records.
High Level comprises of Ecommerce and Analytics, in this case, All data is validated, data is checked to provide trustworthiness. Examples include organization databases.
Mid Level consist of Online Sales and Search engines. Here, Little verification is performed, Data not completely trustworthy, Data is collected with publicly posted forms.
Low Level consist of Blogs and personal posting sites. In this case, Data may not  be verified, low level of trust in content. Examples include public opinion and open contribution.
Integrity Check is a way to measure the consistency of a collection of data. This integrity check performs a process called the hash function and an example is a checksum. A checksum simply convert each piece of information to a value and sum the total. This checksums verifies the integrity of files, or string of characters, before and after they transfer from one device to another across a local network or the internet. Common hash functions include MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512.
Principle of Availability:
Data availability is the principle used to describe the need to maintain availability of information systems and services at all times. Access to information systems and services can be caused by Denial of Service(DoS), malicious attacks, Equipment failures and Natural Disasters.
High availability describes systems designed to avoid downtime. They ensure a level of performance for a higher than normal period. These systems include three design principles which are;
Eliminate Single Points of Failure: Identify all devices and components in a system that would result in a system failure if that device or component fails. Methods to eliminate single points of failures include; hot stand-by devices, redundant components, and multiple connections or pathways.
Provide for Reliable Crossover: Redundant power supplies, backup power systems and backup communications systems all provide for reliable crossover.
Detect Failures as They Occur: Active device and system monitoring detects many types of events including system and device failures, the monitoring systems also trigger the backup system in the case of a failure.
One of the most popular high availability practices is five nines(99.999%) and this means than downtime has less than 5.26 minutes per year. The three approaches to five nines are;
Standardized Systems: This provides for systems that use the same components. Parts inventories are easier to maintain and swapping components during an emergency is possible.
Shared Component Systems: Systems are built so that a backup system can totally replace one that failed.
Clustering: Multiple devices grouped together provide a service that appears to be a single entity to a user. If one device fails, the other devices remain available.
Ensuring Availability: Organizations can ensure availability by implementing the following;
Equipment Maintenance: Regular equipment maintenance can improve system uptime and these include; component replacement, cleaning and alignment.
OS and System Updates: System and OS should be updated on regular schedule. Cybersecurity professionals can subscribe to alerts that announce new update releases.
Backup Systems: Backup of organization data, configuration data and personal data ensures system availability and these backup system should be tested to ensure these systems work properly and that data can be recovered in the event of data loss.
Plan For Disasters: Disaster planning is a critical part of increasing system availability. Employees and customers should know how to respond to a disaster and cybersecurity team should practice response and test backup systems and also be familiar with procedures for restoring critical systems.
New Technology Implementations: Continuous evaluation and testing new technologies to counter new threats and attacks. Cybersecurity professionals are required to use new technologies, products and devices.
Monitor System: Continuous monitoring increase system availability and it should be done with real-time system information.
System Testing: All systems should be tested to find vulnerabilities and this testing includes port scans, vulnerability scans and penetration tests.
Types of Data Storage: Stored data are referred to as data at rest and is a type of storage device that retains the data when no user or process is using it. A storage device can be local(on a computing device) or centralized(on the network). Number of storage options includes;
Direct-Attached Storage(DAS) is a storage connected to a computer. Example; hard drive, flash drive etc. By default, systems are not set up to share direct-attached storage.
Redundant Array of Independent Disks(RAID) uses multiple hard drives in an array , which is a method of combining multiple disks so that the operating system sees them as a single disk. It provides improved performance and fault tolerance.
Network Attached Storage(NAS) is a storage device connected to a network that allows storage and retrieval of data from a centralized location by authorized network users. These devices are flexible and scalable, meaning administrators can increase the capacity as needed.
Storage Area Network(SAN) architecture is a network based storage system. SAN systems connect to the network using high-speed interfaces allowing improved performance and the ability to connect multiple servers to a centralized disk storage repository.
Cloud Storage is a remote storage option that uses space on a data center provider and is accessible from any computer with internet access. Example includes; Google Drive, icloud, and Dropbox.
Challenges of Protecting Stored Data: Direct-Attache Storage(DAS) is one of the most difficult storage to be managed and controlled and it is vulnerable to malicious attacks on the local host. An organization should not store critical data on DAS devices.
Network storage systems offers a more secure option and they include; NAS, SAN, RAID. They provide greater performance and redundancy but they are more complicated to configure and manage. They handle more data therefore, posing more risk if the device fails. Its unique challenge includes; configuring, testing, and monitoring the system.
Methods of Transmitting Data: Transmission of data involves sending information from one device to another, there are numerous ways to transmit information between devices and they are;
Sneaker net: Using removable media to physically move data from one computer to another.
Wired Networks: Use of cables to transmit data. These cables include copper wire and fiber optic media and they can serve the Local Area Network(LAN) or even greater distance like the Wide Area Networks(WAN).
Wireless Networks: They use radio waves to transmit data, they are fast replacing wired networks because they are becoming faster and handle more bandwidth and they expand the number of guest.
Wired and wireless both use packets or data unit. Packets refers to a unit of data that travels between an origin and a destination on the network. Standard protocol like Internet Protocol(IP) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP) define the structure and formation of data packets.
Challenges of Protecting Data In-Transit: This is one of the most challenging jobs of a cybersecurity professional. Some of these challenges and measures to counter them include;
Protecting Data Integrity: Data in transit can be altered by cyber criminals. Cybersecurity professionals can stop that by deploying data integrity systems to test the authenticity of transmitted data to counter these actions.
Protecting Data Availability: Data availability can be interrupted by rogue or unauthorized devices and these can be intercepted using mutual authentication system where the user authenticates the server and the server does same.
Protecting data confidentiality: Data in transit can be stolen, captured. Steps must be taken by cybersecurity professionals to counter these actions.
Forms of Data Processing and Computation: This third state of data in process refers to data during initial input, modification, computation or output.
Protection of data integrity starts with the initial input of data and the method to collect data includes data entry, scanning forms, file uploads, and data collected from sensors. And errors associated with input includes; data entry errors or disconnected, malfunctioning, or inoperable system sensors, mislabeling and incorrect or mismatched data formats.
Data modification refers to changes to the original data. Examples are encoding/decoding, compression/decompression and encryption/decryption. Malicious code also results in data corruption.
Data corruption also occurs during the data output process. Data output refers to outputting data to printers, electronic displays or directly to other devices. Examples of output data corruption include the incorrect use of data delimiters, incorrect communication configurations, and improperly configured printers.
Challenges of Data In-Process: Protecting data during processing requires well designed systems. Cybersecurity professionals design policies and procedures that require testing, maintaining, and updating systems to keep them operating with the least amount of errors. Counter measures include; Access control, Data validation, and Data Duplication.
Software-Based Technology Safeguards: Software safeguards include programs and services that protect operating systems, databases, and other services operating on workstations, portable devices, and servers.
There are several software-based technologies used to safeguard an organization’s assets and they include:
Software firewalls control remote access to a system.
Network and port scanners discover and monitor open ports on a host or server.
Protocol analyzers, or signature analyzers, are devices that collect and examine network traffic. They identify performance problems, detect misconfigurations, identify misbehaving applications, establish baseline and normal traffic patterns, and debug communication problems.
Vulnerability scanners are computer programs designed to assess weaknesses on computers or networks.
Host-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) examine activity on host systems only. An IDS generates log files and alarm messages when it detects unusual activity. A system storing sensitive data or providing critical services is a candidate for host-based IDS.
Hardware-Based Technology Safeguards:There are several hardware-based technologies used to safeguard an organization’s assets and they are;
Firewall appliances block unwanted traffic. Firewalls contain rules that define the traffic allowed into and out of a network.
Dedicated Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) detect signs of attacks or unusual traffic on a network and send an alert.
Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) detect signs of attacks or unusual traffic on a network, generate an alert and take corrective actions.
Content filtering services control access and transmission of objectionable or offensive content.
Network-Based Technology Safeguards: There are networked based technologies used to protect the organization's assets and they include;
Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a secure virtual network that uses the public network (i.e., the Internet). The security of a VPN lies in the encryption of packet content between the endpoints that define the VPN.
Network access control (NAC) requires a set of checks before allowing a device to connect to a network. Some common checks include up-to-data antivirus software or operating system updates installed.
Wireless access point security includes the implementation of authentication and encryption.
Cloud-Based Technology Safeguards: Cloud-based technologies shift the technology component from the organization to the cloud provider. The three main cloud computing services include:
Software as a Service (SaaS) allows users to gain access to application software and databases. Cloud providers manage the infrastructure. Users store data on the cloud provider’s servers.
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides virtualized computing resources over the Internet. The provider hosts the hardware, software, servers, and storage components.
Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides access to the development tools and services used to deliver the applications.
Cloud service providers have extended these options to include IT as a Service (ITaaS), which provides IT support for IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS service models. In the ITaaS model, an organization contracts with the Cloud provider for individual or bundled services. Cloud service providers use virtual security appliances that run inside a virtual environment with a pre-packaged, hardened operating system running on virtualized hardware.
Implementing Cybersecurity Education and Training:  A security awareness program is extremely important for an organization. An employee may not be purposefully malicious but just unaware of what the proper procedures are. There are several ways to implement a formal training program and they are;
Onboarding New Employees: Make security awareness training a part of the employee’s onboarding process.
Security Awareness: Tie security awareness to job requirements or performance evaluations.
In Person Training: Conduct in-person training sessions.
Online Training: Complete online courses.
Security awareness should be an ongoing process since new threats and techniques are always on the horizon.
Establishing a culture awareness is an ongoing effort that requires the leadership of upper management and the commitment of all users and employees and these awareness programs depend on the organization's environment and the level of threat. These culture begins with establishing policies and procedures by management.
A security policy is a set of security objectives for a company that includes rules of behavior for users and administrators and specifies system requirements.Security policies inform users, staff, and managers of an organization’s requirements for protecting technology and information assets. A security policy also specifies the mechanisms needed to meet security requirements
One of the most common security policy components is an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). This component defines what users can and cannot do on the various system components. The AUP should be as explicit as possible to avoid misunderstanding. For example, an AUP lists specific websites, newsgroups, or bandwidth intensive applications that users cannot access using company computers or the company network. 
A security policy includes;
Identification and Authentication Policies, Password Policies, Acceptable Use policies, Remote access policies, Network maintenance policies, Incident handling policies.
Standards documents provide the technologies that specific users or programs need in addition to any program requirements or criteria that an organization must follow. This helps IT staff improve efficiency and simplicity in design, maintenance, and troubleshooting.
Guidelines are a list of suggestions on how to do things more efficiently and securely. They are similar to standards, but are more flexible and are not usually mandatory. Guidelines define how standards are developed and guarantee adherence to general security policies.
Guideline are available at; National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST)-computer security resource center, National Security Agency(NSA) Security configuration guides.
Procedure documents are longer and more detailed than standards and guidelines. Procedure documents include implementation details that usually contain step-by-step instructions and graphics.
Cybersecurity Domains:
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) developed a comprehensive framework to guide information security management. 
ISO/IEC 27000 is an information security standard published in 2005 and revised in 2013. ISO publishes the ISO 27000 standards. Even though the standards are not mandatory, most countries use them as a de facto framework for implementing information security. The ISO 27000 standards describe the implementation of a comprehensive Information Security Management System (ISMS). An ISMS consists of all of the administrative, technical and operational controls to keep information safe within an organization.
Cybersecurity Domain consist of twelve(12) domains and they serve as a common basis for developing organizational security standards and effective security management practices. They are;
Risk management: It determines the quantitative and qualitative value of risk related to a specific situation or recognized threat.
Security policy: A document that addresses the constraints and behaviors of members of an organization and often specifies how data can be accessed and what data is accessible by whom.
Organization of Information Security: This is the governance model set out by an organization for information security.
Asset Management: This is an inventory of and classification scheme for information assets.
Human Resources Security: This addresses security procedures relating to employees joining, moving within and leaving an organization.
Physical and Environmental Security: Ths describes the protection of the computer facilities within an organization.
Communications and operations Management:This describes the management of technical security controls in systems and networks.
Information Systems Acquisition, Development and Maintenance: This describes the integration of security into applications.
Access Control: This describes the restriction of access rights to networks, systems, applications, functions, and data.
Information Security Incident Management: This describes how to anticipate and respond to information security breaches.
Business Continuity Management: This describes the protection, maintenance, and recovery of business critical processes and systems.
Compliance: This describes the process of ensuring conformance with information security policies, standards, and regulations.
The twelve domains consist of control objectives defined in the 27001 part of the standard. The control objectives define the high-level requirements to implement a comprehensive ISM. An organization’s management team uses the ISO 27001 control objectives to define and publish the organization’s security policies. Control objectives provide a checklist to use during security management audits. Many organizations need to pass an ISMS audit in order to earn a designation of ISO 27001 compliant.
Certification and compliance provide confidence for two organizations that need to trust each other’s confidential data and operations. Compliance and security audits prove that organizations are continuously improving their information security management system.
The ISO/IEC 27002 defines information security management system controls. Controls are more detailed than objectives. Control objectives tell the organization what to do. Controls define how to accomplish the objective.
Controls are not mandatory, but they are widely accepted and adopted.
Controls must maintain vendor-neutrality to avoid the appearance of endorsing a specific product or company.
Controls are like guidelines. This means that there can be more than one way to comply with the objective.
The ISO 27001 control objectives serve as a checklist. The first step an organization takes is to determine if these control objectives are applicable to the organization. Most organizations generate a document called the Statement of Applicability (SOA). The SOA defines which control objectives that the organization needs to use.
Industries places greater emphasis on either confidentiality, integrity or availability depending on the type of industry.
Different groups within an organization may be responsible for data in each of the various states. For example, the network security group is responsible for data during transmission. Programmers and data entry people are responsible for data during processing. The hardware and server support specialists are responsible for stored data.
The ISO 27001 control objectives relate directly to the organization’s cybersecurity policies, procedures and guidelines which upper management determines. The ISO 27002 controls provide technical direction. For example, upper management establishes a policy specifying the protection of all data coming in to or out of the organization.
