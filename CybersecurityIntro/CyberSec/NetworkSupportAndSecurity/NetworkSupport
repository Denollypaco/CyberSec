Troubleshooting is the process of identifying, locating and correcting problems. The process involves gathering information and using one or more structured troubleshooting methods.
Seven step troubleshooting process includes;
Definition of problem: The goal of this stage is to verify that there is a problem and then carefully define what the problem is. Problems are usually defined by symptoms, it is important to ask question and investigate the issue in order to localize the problem to a smaller range of possibilities.
Gather information: Th this step, targets to be investigated must be identified, access to the target devices must be obtained, and information gathered. Technicians may gather and document more symptoms depending on the characteristics that are identified.
Analyze information: Possible causes must be identified. The gathered information is interpreted and analyzed using network documentation, network baselines, searching organizational knowledge bases, searching the internet, and talking with other technicians.
Eliminate Possible Causes: If multiple causes are identified, then the list must be reduced by progressively eliminating possible causes to eventually identify the most probable cause.
Propose Hypothesis: When the most probable cause has been identified, a solution must be formulated. At this stage, troubleshooting experience is very valuable when proposing a plan.
Test Hypothesis: Before testing the solution, it is important to assess the impact and urgency of the problem. For instance, could the solution have an adverse effect on other systems or processes? The severity of the problem should be weighed against the impact of the solution. In some cases, a work around can be created until the actual problem is resolved.
Solve the Problem: When the problem is solved, inform the users and anyone involved in the troubleshooting process that the problem has been resolved. Other IT team members should be informed of the solution. It is important to properly document the cause and solution as this can assist other support technicians to prevent and solve similar problems in the future.
Structure Troubleshooting Methods: The troubleshooting method used varies depending on the type of problem and the personal experience of the technician. The below methods can be used to solve a problem
Bottom-Up: Start with the physical layer and the physical components of the network and move up through the layers of the OSI model until the cause of the problem is identified.
Top-Down: Start with the end-user applications and move down through the layers of the OSI model until the cause of the problem has been identified.
Divide and Conquer: Start by collecting user experiences of the problem, document the symptoms and then, using that information, make an informed guess as to which OSI layer to start your investigation.
Follow the Path: Discover the traffic path all the way from source to destination. This approach usually complements one of the other approaches.
Substitution: Physically swap the problematic device or component with a known, working one. If the problem is fixed, then the problem is with the removed item. If the problem remains, then the cause is elsewhere.
Comparison: Compare specifics such as configurations, software versions, hardware, or other device properties, links, or processes between working and nonworking situations and spot significant differences between them.
Educated Guess: A less-structured troubleshooting method that uses an educated guess based on the experience of the technician and their ability to solve problems.
In summary, software problem are solved using a top-down appproach while hardware problem are solved using the bottom-up approach, then new problems may be solved by an experienced technician using the divide and conquer method or bottom up approach. Troubleshooting is a skill that is developed by doing it, any network problem solved is added to your skillset.
Documents Findings, Actions, and Outcomes: It is important to document all informations gathered during troubleshooting. A technician must document the;
Problem: This Includes the initial report of the problem, a description of the symptoms, information gathered and any other information that would help resolve similar problems.
Solution: This includes the steps taken to resolve the problem.
Commands and Tools Used: This includes the commands and tools used in diagonising the problem and solving the problem.
In all, verify the solution with the customer, have them test the solution and try to reproduce the problem once verified that the problem has been resolved, then update the documentation.
The OSI layers includes; Physical(cables, ports,interfaces), Data link(standard switch), Network(Router, multilayer switch), Transport(Router, Multilayer switch), Session, Presentation, Application(End system)
Documentation: Common network documentation includes the following;
Physical and logical network topology diagrams.
Network device documentation that records all pertinent device information.
Network performance baseline documentation.
All network documentation should be kept in a single location, either as hard copy or on the network on a protected server. Backup documentation should be maintained and kept in a separate location.
Types of Networks:
Personal Area Network(PAN): A personal area network (PAN) is a network that connects devices, such as mice, keyboards, printers, smartphones, and tablets within the range of an individual person. These devices are most often connected with Bluetooth technology. Bluetooth is a wireless technology that enables devices to communicate over short distances.
Local Area Network(LAN): A local area network (LAN) is defined as a network that connects devices using wire cables in a small geographical area. However, the distinguishing characteristic for LANs today is that they are typically owned by an individual, such as in a home or small business, or wholly managed by an IT department, such as in a school or corporation.
Virtual Local Area Network(VLAN): allow an administrator to segment the ports on a single switch as if it were multiple switches. This provides more efficient forwarding of data by isolating traffic to only those ports where it is required. VLANs also allow end devices to be grouped together for administrative purposes.
Wireless Local Area Network(WLAN): A wireless LAN (WLAN) is similar to a LAN but wirelessly connects users and devices in a small geographical area instead of using a wired connection. A WLAN uses radio waves to transmit data between wireless devices.
Wireless Mesh Networks(WMN): A wireless mesh network (WMN) uses multiple access points to extend the WLAN. Businesses and municipalities can use WMNs to quickly add new areas of coverage.
Campus Area Network(CAN): is a group of interconnected LANs, belonging to the same organization and operating in a limited geographical area. These can be both academic campuses and business or corporate campuses. Campus area networks typically consist of several buildings interconnected by high-speed Ethernet links using fiber optic cabling.
Metropolitan Area Network(MAN): A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a network that spans across a large campus or a city. The network consists of various buildings connected through wireless or fiber optic media.
Wide Area Network(WAN): A wide area network (WAN) connects multiple networks that are in geographically separated locations. Individuals and organizations contract for WAN access from a service provider. Your service provider for your home or mobile device connects you to the largest WAN, the internet.
Vitual Private Network(VPN): A virtual private network (VPN) is used to securely connect to another network over an insecure network, such as the internet. The most common type of VPN is used by teleworkers to access a corporate private network. Teleworkers are network users that are offsite or remote.
In Enterprise network topologies, there are physical network topology and logical network topology. Different topology diagrams may include; Physical layout and connections, IP address and VLAN management, Security and VPN policies, Cloud services and management, Routing policies, Remote access policies for remote and hybrid workers.
Network Cloud Services and Application: There are three basic types of cloud computing:
Software as a Service(SaaS): Applications focused on the end user. Using this service, applications are usually accessed over the network using a web browser instead of installing the application locally in the end user's computer. Examples of Saas applications includes; Google sheets, Google calendar, Google Maps, Office 365, Salesforce.
Platform as a Service(Paas): This service is primarily for software developers, they provide the servers, storage, security, tools, database and other services to host the consumer's application. In other words, they provide developers where to write their codes whereas the infrastructure and operations are handled by the PaaS provider. Examples of PaaS services includes; Microsoft Azure, Salesforce Lightning, AWS lambda, AWS elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine.
Infrastructure as a Service(Iaas): This a service where computing resources are supplied by a cloud service provider, it provides the virtual machines for storage, networking and other services. It is also responsible for the uptime requirements, power, and security of the VMs. Iaas is also used by both software developers and system administrators, these organizations do not host these systems in their data centers, the VMs and applications are managed by the IaaS cloud provider. Examples of IaaS services includes; Cisco Metacloud, Microsoft Azure, DigitalOcean, Google Compute Engine, Rackspace.
Anything/Everything as a Service(Xaas): This is not a specific cloud service, its defined as the delivery of anything and everything as a service. It examples includes; SaaS, PaaS, Iaas, Disaster recovery as a service(DraaS), Communication as a service(CaaS), Monitoring as a service(MaaS), Desktop as a service(DaaS).
Wireless Standards: These are standards that define how radio frequencies are used for wireless links. Most of the standards specify that wireless devices have one antenna to transmit and receive wireless signals on the specified radio frequency which can be 2.4GHz, 5 GHz or 6 GHz. Some of the newer standards that transmits and receives at higher speed require access points(APs) and wireless clients to have multiple antennas using the multiple-input and multiple-output(MIMO) technology, it helps to improve communication performance.
Licensed and Unlicensed Bands:
 The licensed spectrum refers to the bands (range of frequency) that are reserved for radio stations, cellular companies, and broadcast television stations. Media and cellular companies typical pay for the right to transmit over a specific frequency within the licensed spectrum.
 The unlicensed spectrum is open for anyone to use. The unlicensed spectrum is where we find IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi technologies and is available free to the public. Anyone can transmit over the unlicensed spectrum.
 Network Device Documentation: This shouldcontain accurate, up-to-date records of the network hardware and software, it should include all pertinent information about the network devices.
 Establishing a Network Baseline: A baseline is used to establish normal network or system performance to determine the personality of a network under normal conditions. Establishing a network performance baseline requires collecting performance data from the ports and devices that are essential to network operation. 
 A network baseline should answer the following question; How does the network perform during a normal or average day? Where are the most errors occurring? What part of the network is most heavily used? What part of the network is least used? Which devices should be monitored and what alert thresholds should be set? Can the network meet the identified poicies? 
 The baseline also provides insight into whether the current network design can meet business requirements. Without a baseline, no standard exists to measure the optimum nature of network traffic and congestion levels. The initial network performance baseline sets the stage for measuring the effects of network changes and subsequent troubleshooting efforts. Therefore, it is important to plan for it carefully.
 Cisco Discovery Protocol(CDP):CDP is a Cisco proprietary layer 2 protocol that is used to gather information about Cisco devices which share the same data link. It is media and protocol independent and therefore runs on all Cisco devices, such as routers, switches, and access servers. It can be used to assist in network design decisions, troubleshooting, and making changes to equipment. It can also be used as a network discovery tool to determine the information about the neighboring devices.
